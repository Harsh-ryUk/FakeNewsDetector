Features
## Dataset: Utilizes a curated dataset of labeled news articles.
Preprocessing: Implements text preprocessing techniques such as tokenization, stop word removal, and TF-IDF vectorization.
Model Training: Trains a machine learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.) on the processed data.
Evaluation: Evaluates the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Deployment: Potential deployment strategies, such as web application integration or API services.
